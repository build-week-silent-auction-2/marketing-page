        <h3>Michael Trew</h3>
        <h4>"THE MAN THE LEGEND"</h4>
        <p>
          He came to us with a vision and a plan. We of course laughed it off. He rallied and motivated. We took a nap. He promised the sun, stars and the moon. We are happy with the earth. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three things a wise man fears. 
          The sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.     
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When he came to us with nefarious promises we shook to our bones. We are all wise men in our own rights. The anger of a gentle man has allowed us to deliver this project to you.

        <h3>Daniel Martin</h3>
        <h4>"THE PUPPET MASTER"</h4>
        <p>
          With a blur of fingers across the keyboard he sits there cool and emotionless. Not a single tick of feeling crosses his face as he drops the equivalent of lyrical gold for a major producer. He knows his code is the keystroke version of a god walking among mere mortals. 
          We run to him with cries of a broken back end and all around suffering. With a crack of his knuckles then the brief sound that can only be described as machine guns firing in the distance. He responds "don't worry guys I have fixed our problems." 
        </p>
        <p>
          He played in the dark pulling the strings of the true power of the project. He found the cut ends and repaired. He puts his head down and gets it done. Just a typical tuesday for the puppet master.

        <h3>Mickey R Groff</h3>
        <h4>"THE MAN LIFTING THE PROJECT"</h4>
        <p>
         Once properly motivated by "The Man The Legend " He jumps into action. He has a vision and a purpose. He finds the broken bits laying about all around him and constructs something of beauty and grace. Then on day two he reads what is actually required for this project and realizes he has already met the stretch goals. At this point most of us would pat ourselves on the back tell ourselves how great we are and take a nap. Can he stand for such an injustice of time and effort wasted?  
        </p>
        <p>NO!</p>
        <p>Holding the already "Good enough" project in one hand. He takes above and beyond and makes it appear as childs play. He adds functionality and purpose. He builds. He crafts. He invents. He creates. Then he applies his creations. Like putting on layers in preparation for spending an extended time out in 20 below weather. He adds layer after layer of build, creation, and functionality. Then he looks upon his final creation and deemed it good. 
        </p>

        <h3>Justin McDonald</h3>
        <h4>"THE GUY RIDING THE COATTAILS OF EVERYBODY ELSE"</h4>
        <p>
          He shows up knowing nothing about nothing. He was spoon fed some projects and told to keep it simple stupid. He works diligently and finds what seems to be the answer to all the problems. He then finds there were never actually problems and only himself. Taking the opportunity to absorb the knowledge of those around him that know more than he does (everybody). He learns, he builds, he crafts, he repourposes the work of others. At the end of it all he stands there smiling as if it were he that build the entire thing from the ground up.
